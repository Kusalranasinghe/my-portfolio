            <h2>About me</h2>
            <hr><br>
            <p>I am Kusal Dhananjaya Ranasinghe, a highly motivated student from Kalutara currently pursuing a rigorous
                Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, specializing in a demanding triple
                major of Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics. My educational journey began at Kalutara Gnanodaya
                Maha Vidyalaya (2009–2013), culminating in a successful pass in the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination with
                166 marks. I then transitioned to Ananda Sastralaya National School, Mathugama (2014–2022), where I
                achieved strong results in the 2019 G.C.E. O/L Examination (2A, 6B, 1C) and successfully completed the
                Physical Science stream A/L examinations in 2023, earning my place at university. Beyond academics, I
                was deeply involved in school life as a dedicated member of the Cricket Team from 2014 to 2022, notably
                participating in two Big Matches and serving as the Captain of the Under 19 Cricket Team in 2022, which
                instilled valuable leadership and teamwork skills. To augment my formal degree, I hold an Information
                Technology Diploma from IMBS Green Campus and an English Diploma from Aquinas College, ensuring
                technical proficiency and strong professional communication. My commitment to diligence and service is
                underpinned by my family's values, with my father, Mr. Hemantha Ranasinghe, working as an Administrative
                Officer in the Excise Department, and my mother, Mrs. Renuka Perera, serving as a Teacher. Collectively,
                this unique blend of advanced scientific study, demonstrated leadership, and practical technical and
                language qualifications equips me to excel in complex technical and analytical environments.</p>

                My formal education began at Kalutara Gnanodaya Maha Vidyalaya, where I completed my primary schooling
                from Grade 1 to Grade 5 (2009–2013). My strong academic aptitude was demonstrated by successfully
                passing the highly competitive Grade 5 Scholarship Examination with 166 marks, which secured my
                transition to one of the region's leading schools. From 2014 to 2022, I attended Ananda Sastralaya
                National School, Mathugama, where I progressed from Grade 6 through to the Advanced Level. My commitment
                to excellence was evident in the G.C.E. O/L Examination in 2019, where I achieved commendable results
                with 2 'A' passes, 6 'B' passes, and 1 'C' pass. I subsequently elected to pursue the demanding Physical
                Science stream for my A/L studies, a decision that successfully culminated in my selection to the
                University of Sri Jayewardenepura for my Bachelor of Science degree. Beyond academics, my time at Ananda
                Sastralaya was deeply enriched by my involvement in sports; I was a dedicated member of the school
                Cricket Team from 2014 to 2022, proudly representing the school in two major annual Big Matches. This
                culminated in a significant leadership role in 2022, where I was appointed the Captain of the Under 19
                Cricket Team, an experience that honed my skills in team management, strategic thinking, and leadership
                under pressure.
